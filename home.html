                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">journal entry 01 // one of the key question that I have been asking myself is to define what is <b>good architecture</b> to me. I for one, find it very challenging to define it in words, Like many aesthetic questions, whether we speak of art, music or poetry, it is hard to define exactly what is architecture and its environment. I will still try though....Architecture to me,  is an environment or a perceived sensation of that environment. It is an ambiance that influences the emotional state of a person, their feelings moods and sensations. Good design to me is one that intends to find feelings rather than forms, where human emotions lie at the heart of its creation.</figcaption>

My design comes from personal observations and experiences cannot be called as a strictly logical process. I believe, to create something that is so personal that is intended to move people and evoke human emotions, my own past experiences and personal feelings play an important role in designing in order to create new experiences through architecture.
                      <br>
                      It cannot be merely seen as solutions of pragmatism but is a conscious creation that is extracted from different aspects of our intelligence and personality and thus can be very intuitive in nature. Thus, Functionality of architecture cannot be measured whether or not it is a practical design, but radical consideration of the atmosphere it creates is a a function of design too.</figcaption>

But in architecture, atmosphere is generally a term that is used to describe an intangible characteristic that permeates our built environments. It is used as a term that qualifies a description of an environment or is preceded by qualifying adjectives. 
                      <br>
                      However, I would like to engage with the notion of atmosphere with another added layer  that describe it as a perception of a spatial experience. While it is a physical phenomenon, it also suggests an emotion of the space itself, something  that would be experienced by one's body and understood in one's consciousness.</figcaption>

The link between architecture and my memories is very evident.  Through a first-person approach to architecture, one imagines an experience that is inspired from personal possessions, intuitive and first-hand experiences which are referential to specific memories of the individual. I would argue that architecture alone cannot produce any emotion unless we associate it with our memory. Our childhood memory is a fertile ground for our imagination.  Imagination is vital to make architecture that is essential to the lived experience</figcaption>

Usually the process of design begins with the conception of architecture as an abstract whole and progressively moves towards a more visual dimension without their being any consideration of architecture’s atmospheric dimension. Pallasmaa puts this view forward by criticising such architecture. The quality of a building or a built ensemble cannot be determined in the final analysis by the eye or the central view point in a photo, the quality of architecture can essentially only be judged by spiritual presence.</figcaption>

                      To engage with both, the body and the mind,  one needs to create an architectural experience that is a result of a subconscious engagement of all senses with the surrounding world. Philospher Bohme suggest the use of the  human body not only as a fundamental measure of architecture but also as an instrument which absorbs and considers the architectural quality and the atmosphere of its environment.</figcaption>

"The way we see things is affected by what we know or what we believe” Ways of Seeing, John Berger.  Thus as an architect I do not wish to authorise someone to feel in a  specific manner in a space, rather architecture should act as a medium that invites emotion, simply allows the individual the ability to feel something through the work. Thus in that sense, the perception of such spaces, becomes a much more internalised experience.</figcaption>
